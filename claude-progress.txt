# SmIA Progress Tracker
# Updated: 2026-02-13

## Current Status
- Initializer phase COMPLETE
- Project skeleton fully set up
- Ready to begin Phase 1: Backend Foundation

## Completed
- [x] Read PRD.md thoroughly
- [x] Studied Anthropic harness article patterns
- [x] Created features.md with phase-grouped checklist
- [x] Created claude-progress.txt
- [x] Scaffolded backend (uv + FastAPI + routes/services/models/core)
- [x] Cloned YARS library to libs/yars/
- [x] Scaffolded frontend (Vite + React 19 + Chakra UI v3 + routing)
- [x] Created root config (vercel.json, .env.example, shared/types.ts)
- [x] Set up Supabase tables (user_bindings, analysis_reports) with RLS
- [x] Migrated frontend from npm to pnpm
- [x] Initial commit + push

## Next Steps (Phase 1: Backend Foundation)
1. Implement core/config.py with full env loading
2. Implement models/schemas.py with all Pydantic models
3. Implement services/database.py with Supabase CRUD operations
4. Implement services/tools.py with Reddit (YARS), YouTube (API v3), Amazon (Crawl4AI) tools
5. Implement services/agent.py with PydanticAI agent + structured output
6. Implement core/langfuse_config.py with observability decorators
7. Implement routes/analyze.py with full analysis pipeline
8. Implement routes/reports.py with CRUD + filtering
9. Test end-to-end analysis pipeline

## Blockers
- None

## Key Decisions
- YARS: git clone (not pip install) per user preference
- pnpm instead of npm for frontend package management
- Chakra UI v3 uses createSystem/defineConfig API (not v2's extendTheme)
- Sequential initializer approach chosen
- Supabase project: fueryelktpkkwipwyswu
