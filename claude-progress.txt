# SmIA Progress Tracker — Dashboard Cold Start Fix
# Updated: 2026-02-26

## Current State
Dashboard cold start fix completed and pushed to `development` branch.

## What Was Done
- Diagnosed Dashboard slow loading (5-10s) as Vercel serverless cold start issue
- Added sessionStorage SWR cache to Dashboard.tsx — cached data shown instantly on revisit
- Optimized count query in database.py (select id instead of *)
- Verified: 256 backend tests pass, frontend builds clean
- Committed: 59aebc2, pushed to development
- Plan recorded: docs/plans/2026-02-26-dashboard-cold-start-fix.md
- Added "Plan documentation" rule to CLAUDE.md Working Rules

## What's Next (candidates)
- AI Daily Digest frontend (Steps 7-9): hooks, admin page, digest page, history/sharing
- Security hardening (docs/plans/security-hardening.md)
- Phase 4 polish items from docs/features.md
- Consider upgrading to Vercel Pro for cron keep-alive (eliminates first-visit cold start too)

## Blockers
- None
