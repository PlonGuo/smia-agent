I was halfway through recording an interview for a short video series, with my questions lined up, a rough script in mind, and a clear destination.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, the conversation went off-road. The guest started telling a story that had absolutely nothing to do with my questions. It was long, winding, and honestly a bit chaotic\u2014jumping from one topic to another like thoughts were a pile of tumbleweeds rolling around.\n\nMy producer instinct kicked in: \"Okay, cut them off, get back on track.\" But something stopped me. I just leaned back and let Plaud keep recording in the background.\n\nLater, while making lunch, I listened back to the playback. I expected to cringe at the rambling parts. Instead, I found a goldmine.\n\nThere were these tiny, human moments\u2014funny expressions, odd little asides, glimpses of personality that would have been impossible to script. They ended up being the best clips in the final video, the exact moments people commented on first.\n\nIt made me realize: sometimes the best content isn\u2019t what you prepared. The detours, the randomness, the stories that feel like \"entropy\"\u2014that\u2019s the stuff that actually sticks.",
